A Landfill Near You
===================

This is a Processing sketch that automatically takes an image of all landfills in the country.  Code was derived from Josh Begley's Prison Map project.

The file lat/lon file associated with this repo was made from an output from the EPA Echo Database.  This is not the entirety of the database, only a portion used for testing.  The full output will come shortly.
